# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

* This code is for a game which allows interaction between the uers and the browser. Questions are displayed to the user in a timeframe in which they have to complete the quiz. Wrong answers deduct time to their score. When finished with the quiz the user score is their time. 

* This code contains minimal hard coded elements within the HTML. This code is dynamically changing based on where the user is at in the quiz. By building the webpage like this it allows for better user interactivity with the browser and JS makes it easier to access elements on a webpage and minipulate them.
